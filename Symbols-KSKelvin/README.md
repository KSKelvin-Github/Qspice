## Symbols-KSKelvin
* .qsym files in Symbols-KSKelvin are designed to be used in Qspice
* You can directly download any file individually by navigating into it; there is a download icon at the top right corner
* To use 3rd-party symbols, you can either directly drag the file from the file explorer into the schematic, OR, the best way, is to add the folder containing .qsym files to the Symbol & IP Browser in the Qspice schematic window
* There are two methods to download the entire library; the cloning method is recommended as it allows for easier updates, but with more steps to go through in the initial setup

## Method 1 : Download Symbol Library without Cloning
* Visit the 3rd-party web tool: https://download-directory.github.io/<br/>
* Paste the URL https://github.com/KSKelvin-Github/Qspice/tree/main/Symbols-KSKelvin and press Enter<br/>
* Download the .zip file and unzip it to a folder<br/>
* In Qspice, navigate to View > Symbol & IP Browser, and add this folder from the Symbol & IP Browser window<br/>

## Method 2 : Cloning with Github Desktop (Recommend)
* Download GitHub Desktop from GitHub : https://desktop.github.com/download/ , You may need to create a GitHub account (free)
* To download a repository, follow this video guide : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZNIbs_wx8
* Use this URL path to clone KSKelvin-Github/Qspice: https://github.com/KSKelvin-Github/Qspice.git
* Once cloning is finished, in GitHub Desktop, navigate to Repository > Show in Explorer to access the saved directory
* In Qspice, navigate to View > Symbol & IP Browser, and add this folder from the Symbol & IP Browser window<br/>
* In the future, to update files, open GitHub and click on Pull origin or go to Repository > Pull from the menu<br/>
