** LTspice to Qspice conversion checklist

* Direct change of netlist
1. Diode .model - If D model with Ron=0, change it to Ron=1m
2. I-source (current source) with instance parameter LOAD doesn't source power, change LOAD to VSAT=0.5

* matlab file : "LTspice2Qspice_A_Device.m"
1. Use it to convert A-device (AND, OR, XOR, SRFLOP, DFLOP, SCHMITT) to Qspice ¥-device

* text file : "LTspice .model to Qspice .subckt.txt"
1. Diode .model - If D model with Ilimit, refer to this document and substitute with equivalent subcircuit model
2. Switch .model - If SW model with Vser/Ilimit, refer to this document and substitute with equivalent subcircuit model
3. A-device type Varistor, refer to this document and substitute with equivalent subcircuit model
